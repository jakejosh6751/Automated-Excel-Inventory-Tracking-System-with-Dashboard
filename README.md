# Automated Excel Inventory Tracking System with Dashboard

### About this project
This project is an automated inventory tracking system built in Excel with macros, Power Query, and dashboards. It streamlines the management of product purchases, sales, and stock levels. The system automatically updates KPIs, inventory status, and dashboards when new transactions are entered. It is designed for small to medium-sized businesses to track inventory movement, monitor stock availability, and evaluate sales performance without relying on external software.
